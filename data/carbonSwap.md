# CarbonSwap Overview

CarbonSwap is a digital marketplace that connects companies with credible NGOs to simplify the carbon offset process in a transparent and measurable way.

The platform enables companies to purchase emission reduction activities such as mangrove planting, forest restoration, or renewable projects. It provides official certification, monitoring reports, and AI-powered carbon impact predictions, helping companies meet ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) responsibilities efficiently.

The marketplace operates with two user types:
- **Buyers:** Companies seeking carbon offset projects.
- **Sellers:** NGOs offering verified emission reduction projects.

## Problem Statement

Between 2019 and 2023, greenhouse gas emissions from Indonesia's industry sector increased by **16.25%**, while household emissions rose only **1.29%**.

Globally, CO₂ concentration growth rates have tripled since the 1960s — from an annual average increase of **0.8 ppm per year** to **2.4 ppm per year** between 2011–2020. In 2023–2024, the global CO₂ concentration surged by **3.5 ppm**, the largest increase since modern records began in 1957.

Indonesia, however, has significant carbon absorption potential — capable of offsetting **hundreds of billions of tons of emissions** due to its vast forests and conservation areas.

Despite this potential, companies in Indonesia face multiple challenges in fulfilling ESG obligations:

1. **Difficulty Identifying Credible NGOs**  
   Companies struggle to find and verify trusted environmental partners for carbon offset initiatives.

2. **Lack of Transparency & Real-Time Monitoring**  
   It's hard to monitor actual progress of offset projects like mangrove planting or forest regeneration.

3. **Complex Compliance & Documentation**  
   ESG reporting demands verifiable proof of carbon offset activities, which is difficult to manage manually.
